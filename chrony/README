Old:
The chrony service starts based on the existence of the dhcpcd pid.
But this does not necessarily mean that the interface is correctly defined.

New:
The chrony service will start correctly based
on the defined interface in the conf file - the IFACE variable.

If you have a different interface name, change the IFACE value.
